# Lesson 7 - Reusable Code (Script)

## Introduction
> Now that we have a working, validated `name` input component. How easy would it be to reuse some of that code and get our age input working again? Well, pretty easy it turns out! 
# Create component
> Let's create a new component called `InputAge.vue`.

# Show off functionality with 2 inputs
